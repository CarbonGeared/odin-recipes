        <h3>Sweet Coconut Sticky Rice Desert</h3>

        <p>This is a traditional Thai/Lao desert that is made out of coconut soaked
            sticky rice wrapped around a sweet banana. Often times, this desert will 
            be made with black beans as well, giving it another layer of flavor.
        </p>
        
        <p>This was a favorite desert of mine when I was a kid. Nothing brings back memories
            more than the smells and taste of a desert you used to have all the time!
